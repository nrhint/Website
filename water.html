<h1>Water</h1>
<p>Water is a vital resource and is often under estemated. Most people dont think about how much water they drink and only drink when they are thiristy or thinking about it. In face we are slowly beacoming more dehydrated the older we get as we drink less and less water as we get older. If anything you should drink more water as you age. As we get more and more advanced we realize more and more how much we rely on water in our daily lives. Much of the tile you are feeling sick or down you are auctauly thiristy. This is because we are training our bodies to ignore the need for water and as we do that our bodies make the symptoms more extreme to get our attention. This is part of why medicines are getting less effective. Yes as we use medication the viruses and bacteria evolve to beacome more resestiant to medicines. It is also because we take them without thought to how much water we have had.</p>
<p>Many of the common problems can be solved by simply drinking more water. Being thiristy is the first stage of dehydration. I had to get up and get a drink as I was writing this. Thinking about water will often make us thiristy because our bodies want it to use. A common misconception is that we all need to dring x amount of water per day. In reality you should drink as much as your body needs. For people who are more active this will be more than people that do less. </p>
