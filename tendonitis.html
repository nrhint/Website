<h1>Tendonitis:</h1>
This page contains information in tendinitis from wikipedia.  for the page see the links section at the bottom.<br>

<p>This is a class of tendon injuries. Many tendon injuries would fall under this catogory.</p>

<h3>Symptoms:</h3>
<p>Symptoms vary from pains and local stiffness, toa burning that surrounds the whole joint around the inflaimed tendon. Sometimes swelling occours allong with heat and redness, and there may be visable knots sorrounding the joint. With swelling the pain is usauly worse during and after activity and the tendon and joint can beacome stiff the following day.  This is caused by muscles tightining to protect the tendon from furthurer injury.  many patients report that stress in their life correlates with the pain level and often a pain will start during a stressful time.</p>
<h3>Information about Tendinopathy</h3>
<p>Tendinopathy, also known as tendinitis or tendinosis, is a type of tendon disorder that results in pain, swelling, and impaired function. The pain is typically worse with movement. It most commonly occurs around the shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip, knee, or ankle.</p>

<p>Causes may include an injury or repetitive activities. Groups at risk include people who do manual labor, musicians, and athletes. Less common causes include infection, arthritis, gout, thyroid disease, and diabetes. Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms, examination, and occasionally medical imaging. A few weeks following an injury little inflammation remains, with the underlying problem related to weak or disrupted tendon fibrils.</p>

<p>Treatment may include rest, NSAIDs, splinting, and physiotherapy. Less commonly steroid injections or surgery may be done. About 80% of people get better within 6 months. Tendinopathy (WHAT IS THIS?) is relatively common. Older people are more commonly affected.</p>
