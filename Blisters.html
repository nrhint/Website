<h3>Symptoms:</h3>
<p>Symptoms of blisters is a feeling of heat called a hot spot.  This occours before the blister forms and of you feel a itching and heat in a spot you are likely forming a blister there. When a blister is fuly formed it can have many appearances. some blisters swell up and you can see an air bubble under the skin. On some blisters the skin tears off and they beacome an open sore.  Finaly some blisters fill up with blood. These are called blood blisters.</p>
<h1>Treatments:</h1>
<p>What you do with the blister depends on how brave you are and what you do often.  If you need a blister to heal fast, you can pop it then take a little apple cider vinagar and gently bathe the blister in the vinager. This is painful but it will harden the skin exposed in a day or two. This makes the blister tougher so if you are going to do the same thing or something simlar to that it will be les tender. Another thing that you can do is to let the blister heal normaly without bothering it. This is the best way in the long run as after a blistar heals there is often a peice of very tough skin left behind called a callous. This will provide extra protection and help to prevent another blistar from forming.</p>
<h3>Information about resarch:</h3>
<p>This information I gathered from what I have been taught and what I heard while participating in dancing. The Apple cider vinager trick I heard about from Lizzie Rawlings.</p>
